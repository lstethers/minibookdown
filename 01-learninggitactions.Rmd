# Learning Git Actions

_Obligatory introductory chapter._

## About Actions
Actions and workflows can do a lot, but are definitely hard to get your head around initially.

## Things I'd like do with Actions
1. Push a file to make it available for lib staff: Push a file to Google Drive each time it is committed.
2. Testing: Run an XSLT file against a directory of XML files every time the XSLT file is committed. Send the resulting formatted output/errors to either email, to the screen, or to a folder so I can review them.
3. Testing: Spin up a web server so I can test my php forms on it every time they are committed
